# Overnight-Render-Manager
This is a render manager for those people who need to render their blender projects overnight. 

Running your laptop or desktop overnight is actually bad for it.
A laptop may run out of battery or if it's plugged in, It may cuase battery to overheat or/and cause damage to the mother board. Desktops are very power hungry, and may continue using that much power even after rendering if let uncontrolled.

That's where this programme comes in. The Overnight Render Manager let's you manage your blender renders and shutdown the pc after all the renders.

NOTE: This program is still in development.

## Requirements:
    - python3
    - python-gobject
    - gtk3
    
## How to use:
Run the overnight_render.py inside the pygtk folder.
